/* Question: Write a function called minimax that takes M, a matrix input argument and returns mmr, a row vector containing the absolute 
values of the difference between the maximum and minimum valued elements in each row. As a second output argument called mmm, it provides 
the difference between the maximum and minimum element in the entire matrix.  /*

/* Solution /*

function [mmr mmm] = minimax(M)
mmr=max(M')-min(M')
mmm=max(max(M))-min(min(M))
